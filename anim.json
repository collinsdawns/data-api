      "description":"Although James Cameron's Avatar: The Game is named after the movie, the story itself doesn't follow the plot of the film. Instead the player takes on the role of Lance Corporal Ryder, a signal-specialist who is send to the distant moon Pandora. But Ryder isn't just any other soldier. Instead he or she is one of the selected group of people that take part in the so-called Avatar-program. Avatars are a hybrid of Na'vi DNA and human DNA that have been created in order to better interact with the inhabitants of the planet: the Na'vi, tribe-like and technology-wise not very advanced people that are one with nature. Although the Na'vi are friendly to the new-comers at first, soon the humans want more than just diplomatic relations. They want to relocate the Na'vi in order to be able to strip the planet of its natural resources. A war breaks out which only one side can win - it is up to the player which it will be. Early in the game the player has to decide weather he wants to help the Na'vi unlock the power of the Well of Souls or if he wants to stay with the humans. Depending on his choice, the gameplay changes significantly: * Human: As a human the player can enter buildings, drive vehicles like buggies and helicopters and use full-body armor as well as several different kinds of firearms including shotguns and flamethrowers. In addition Pandora itself is against him meaning both plants and animals will attack the player but will also grant experience points. As a human the player can build pods that replenish ammo and health a specific locations. Na'vi: The Na'vi are more than two meters high and as such can neither enter buildings nor use humans vehicles. But Pandora herself is friendly so plants and animals won't attack (or give experience points for that matter) allowing the player to ride strange horses or fly around on huge dinosaur-like creatures. While the player himself is able to use a machine gun, normally the Na'vi rely on bows and arrows as well as strange swords and staves. If the player manages to pull of a five-hit-combo, a special attack comes available. Na'vi harvest plants in order to get arrows and cell samples."

      "description":"Although Spider-Man: Web of Shadows shares some features as previous Spider-Man games there are also many differences including no movie connection for starters. A flashback in the beginning reveals how a fight with Venom causes some symbiote to attach to Spider-Man giving him greater strength. Spider-Man then meets Luke Cage who helps train him to defeat the city gangs. During an attempt to save some gang leaders from assassins, Spider-Man is attacked by residents who are controlled by symbiote. The symbiote substance terrorizes the city as it spreads and attaches to innocent citizens. Spider-Man begins a quest to save New York City. He sees the epidemic sweeping the streets below as he’s able to swing over and between buildings with great speed and agility hunting down baddies. Don’t worry about falling from buildings as Spider-Man seems to be unaffected by the plunge. When under attack, just mashing the X button enables Spider-Man to punch and conquer. The player has the ability to change suits easily where you can defeat bad guys as either the red Spidey using his web or the black Spidey using the tendrils from the symbiote. Other destructive combo attacks are the same regardless of suit color. Choosing one suit color over the other is more of a player’s personal choice for each fight and doesn’t have an impact on the game’s outcome. However, the player will be forced to make decisions during the game that are equal to Spider-Man’s red suit or black suit morals. The choices made at these times will lead the player to different endings based on the paths taken. Points are earned as he fights crime and advances to help upgrade moves and actions."
